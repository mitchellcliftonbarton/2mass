    text: 'The Zone of Avoidance is the area of sky hidden from our view by the Milky Way galaxy. Multiple surveys have been done in the last century in order to attain new knowledge about the Zone of Avoidance, giving more complete pictures of the space and increasing our understanding of its content. But even with this new information, much of the area remains incomplete in our understanding â€” stars and objects in the foreground are confused with galaxies that lay in the background, coming forward and shifting back, thus limiting our knowledge of the space.'
